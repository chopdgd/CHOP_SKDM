# CHOP_SKDM

SKDM tool helps to investigate HLA associations, and automate their analysis in the context of a case– control design through complex computation. 
The SKDM HLA Tool can test for HLA allele differences between two populations and perform amino acid analysis by retrieving amino acid sequences. Once primary associations are identified, the program examines zygosity and tests for strongest association, interaction and linkage disequilibrium among amino acid epitopes of the same HLA molecule or between HLA isotypes. A summary of the analysis is output in plain language. 


This is the upgraded version of the application. 
The older version is here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/skdm/


The upgraded version of SKDM is available at https://github.com/chopdgd/CHOP_SKDM. 

Once you unzip the sourcecode:
``` 
cd dist/
```

You only need the main executable “SKDM_2.1.jar” under the “dist” folder to run this program. 
In order to execute the program, simply double click on the icon or on the filename, SKDM_2.1.jar. 

or on the commandline: 
java -jar SKDM_2.1.jar

If you cannot execute this file for any reason, you may need to install the latest version of Java on your machine. 
To do that, go to the following website and download a free version of Java: http://www.java.com/en/download/
