This is the upgraded version of the application. 
The older version is here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/skdm/

Once you unzip the sourcecode:

cd dist/

You only need the main executable “SKDM_2.1.jar” under the “dist” folder to run this program. 
In order to execute the program, simply double click on the icon or on the filename, SKDM_2.1.jar. 

or on the commandline: 
java -jar SKDM_2.1.jar

If you cannot execute this file for any reason, you may need to install the latest version of Java on your machine. 
To do that, go to the following website and download a free version of Java: http://www.java.com/en/download/
